:slug: issues

The following are known issues (bugs, if you will) that you may encounter after downloading *S. Cargo*. If you have trouble running the game, try playing it from a console to view the error messages. The warning level can be increased by editing *assets/logging.conf*.

- On *some* GNU/Linux systems, the first level will fail to start due to `an error in Python re-initialisation <http://projects.blender.org/tracker/?atid=306&group_id=9&func=browse>`_. A fix has been found; we are waiting for it to be applied to Blender.
