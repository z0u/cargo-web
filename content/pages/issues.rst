:slug: issues

The following are known issues (bugs, if you will) that you may encounter after downloading *S. Cargo*. If you have trouble running the game, try playing it from a console to view the error messages. The warning level can be increased by editing *assets/logging.conf*.

- On *some* GNU/Linux systems, the first level will fail to start due to `an error in Python re-initialisation <http://developer.blender.org/T36963>`_. This is potentially fixed in *S. Cargo* version 0.95.
- On Mac computers with Intel video cards, `the frame rate of animations is low <http://developer.blender.org/T37514>`_ (even if the overall frame rate is high). This is true even if a "discrete" graphics card (such as nVidia) is present too.
