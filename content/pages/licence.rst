Source Code
===========

*S. Cargo* is written in Python, so the source code is available in the normal download. The graphical assets are editable in Blender and the GIMP - except for the first scene (the one that shows the *Smidgin* logo). The files used to generate certain assets, including the first scene and build scripts, will be made available soon.
