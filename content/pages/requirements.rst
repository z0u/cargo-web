GNU/Linux and Windows
=====================

If you have a recent desktop or laptop computer, then *S. Cargo* should work on it.
*S. Cargo* runs well on Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 on computers manufactured since 2011. Minimum Specifications:

- **CPU:** i686 and x86_64 processors are supported. These processors are common in desktop and laptop computers. Your CPU must be at least as fast as the `Intel Core i5 U430`_.
- **Video:** Intel, nVidia and AMD video cards are supported. Your video card must support OpenGL 4 and be at least as fast as the `AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430`_. For some cards, you may need to use proprietary video drivers (i.e. those provided by the video card manufacturer) to get the required graphics performance. Sorry about that.

*S. Cargo* may not work on platforms other than those listed above. ARM CPUs (which are common in mobile devices such as tablets) are not supported.

Mac OS X (beta release)
=======================

*S. Cargo* runs well on the Macbook Pro with Retina (2.5 GHz I5 and 8GB Ram) and the Mac Mini (2.5 GHz I5 4GB Ram).

This is a `beta release`_ of S. Cargo for **64-bit Mac OS X 10.6+**. It's fully playable, but it `might be slow on some computers`_. If you buy S. Cargo for OS X and find that it doesn't play well on your computer, you can:

- Try running it in a Windows virtual machine e.g. using Parallels.
- `Download the source code`_ and play the game in Blender.
- Ask us for a refund.

Any feedback about this would be appreciated. Please let us know whether it runs well for you, and what kind of Apple computer you have. You can leave a comment in the `issue tracker`_ or tweet to `@asmidgin`_.
