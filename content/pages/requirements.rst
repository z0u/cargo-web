GNU/Linux and Windows
=====================

If you have a recent desktop or laptop computer, then *S. Cargo* should work on it.
*S. Cargo* runs well on Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 on computers manufactured since 2011. Minimum Specifications:

- **CPU:** i686 and x86_64 processors are supported. These processors are common in desktop and laptop computers. Your CPU must be at least as fast as the `Intel Core i5 U430`_.
- **Video:** Intel, nVidia and AMD video cards are supported. Your video card must support OpenGL 4 and be at least as fast as the `AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430`_. For some cards, you may need to use proprietary video drivers (i.e. those provided by the video card manufacturer) to get the required graphics performance. Sorry about that.

*S. Cargo* may not work on platforms other than those listed above. ARM CPUs (which are common in mobile devices such as tablets) are not supported.

Mac OS X
========

*S. Cargo* is currently unavailable on OS X. It does work on some Mac computers, but the `required hardware is fairly rare`_. If you are super keen you can try playing in Blender by `downloading the S. Cargo source`_ - but be warned that this can be a complicated process. An official build for OS X may be published later.

Users have reported that *S. Cargo* can be played in a Windows virtual machine (e.g. under Parallels) on OS X.
