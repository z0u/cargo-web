:slug: requirements


If you have a recent desktop or laptop computer, then *S. Cargo* should work on it. See below for further information.


Mac OS X
========

*S. Cargo* has been tested to run well on 2013 model Mac laptops running OS X 10.6 with nVidia graphics cards. It may not work on older Mac computers, nor Macs with Intel graphics cards. Mac computers with AMD/ATI graphics cards have not been tested.


GNU/Linux and Windows
=====================

*S. Cargo* runs well on Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 on computers manufactured since 2011. Minimum Specifications:

- **CPU:** i686 and x86_64 processors are supported. These processors are common in desktop and laptop computers. Your CPU must be at least as fast as the `Intel Core i5 U430`_.
- **Video:** nVidia and AMD video cards are supported. Your video card must support OpenGL 4 and be at least as fast as the `AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430`_. You may need to use proprietary video drivers (i.e. those provided by the video card manufacturer) to get the required graphics performance. Sorry about that.

*S. Cargo* may not work on platforms other than those listed above. ARM CPUs (which are common in mobile devices such as tablets) are not supported.
