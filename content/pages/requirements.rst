**Over-simplified summary:** *S. Cargo* has been tested to run on Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7. If you have a desktop or laptop computer that was manufactured in the last few years, and it is not a Mac, then *S. Cargo* should work on it. See below for further information.

Minimum Specifications:

 - **CPU:** i686 and x86_64 processors are supported. These processors are common in desktop and laptop computers. Your CPU must be at least as fast as the `Intel Core i5 U430`_.
 - **Video:** nVidia and AMD video cards are supported. Your video card must support OpenGL 4 and be at least as fast as the `AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430`_. You may need to use proprietary video drivers (i.e. those provided by the video card manufacturer) to get the required graphics performance. Sorry about that.

*S. Cargo* may not work on platforms other than those listed above â€” although a Mac OSX version is in the works. ARM CPUs (which are common in mobile devices such as tablets) are not supported.
